        <h2>Hiking in Arizona</h2>
        <p>Arizona contains parts of 4 different deserts. Phoenix is located in the Sonoran Desert. 
            Since it is in a desert, temperatures during the day can be hot, the sun is bright, and 
            there may be limited shade on certain trails. The best times of year to visit hiking are in the spring and fall. While this website focuses on hiking in Phoenix, 
            there are many beautiful hiking locations throughout Arizona, such as the Grand Canyon and Sedona.
            It is important to be prepared when going on a hike in these conditions. This includes bringing enough water, bringing sun protection, and doing research
            before starting a trail. Because Phoenix is in a desert, the landscape is unique as it has variety
            of interesting rock formations, large stretches of flat land, and special flora and fauna. For example, there is the Hole-in-the-Rock 
            trail in Papago Park where hikers walk go through, as the name suggests, a hole in a rock. Throughout the desert, hikers can see the iconic saguaro cactus which can only be found in the Sonoran Desert.
            Hikers may also see some desert animals on near trails.
            The trails near Phoenix offer a variety of difficulties, lengths, views, and rock formations to experience. This makes
            Phoenix a great destination for anyone looking to spend time outdoors and appreciate the beauty of the desert no matter their level of experience hiking.
            This page will provide information about some key hiking locations. Many of these locations have several trails for hikers to explore. See below for more information on different places to hike in Phoenix!

        <h2>Papago Park</h2>
            <p>
                Papago Park is located near downtown Phoenix and has a myriad of activities, including the 
                Phoenix Zoo, the Desert Botanical Garden, and Hunt's Tomb. The park has several sandstone buttes that define the parks' landscape.
                In addition, it has several hiking trails which allow hikers to view and hike on or around interesting rock formations in the park. 
                One such hike is called Hole-in-the-Rock. It is a short hike where hikers can hike up a rock formation  
                and take in the beautiful scenery around them. There is a large hole in the formation that 
                hikers can stand in to get views from both sides of the rock. Near the Hole-in-the-Rock trail is also the Crosscut
                Canal Trail Path, Nature Trail, and Ranger Office Loop Trail. All of these hikes are easy and provide nice views of the park.
                The Crosscut Canal Trail Path starts at Hole-in-the-Rock, runs along the banks of the canal, and passes the zoo and botanical garden.
                In the western part of the park, there are several more easy trails, including Big Butte Loop Trail which passes by an amphitheater,
                Double Butte Loop Trail, Elliot Ramada Loop Trail, Little Butte Loop Trail, and Papago Park 5k Fitness Trail.

        <h2>Camelback Mountain</h2>
        <p>
            Camelback Mountain is named for its shape as two rock formations resemble a camel’s head and the back of a kneeling 
            camel. Camelback Mountain has two extremely difficult trails: Cholla Trail and Echo Canyon Trail. Near the start of 
            Echo Canyon Trail, there is a short easy hike called Bobby’s Rock Trail that is an option for hikers not looking for 
            a difficult hike but still want to experience Camelback Mountain up close and to hike to a beautiful view. 
            Cholla Trail is slightly longer and less difficult compared to Echo Canyon Trail. It is an extremely difficult hike 
            as there is extremely steep and rocky terrain, especially near the summit, and there is little shade from the hot 
            Arizona sun. Echo Canyon trail is extremely steep and difficult. It offers little shade and few places to rest.  There 
            are some sections with handrails and other aids for hikers. This trail is generally considered one of the best locations 
            for experienced hikers.

            <h2>McDowell Mountains</h2>
            <p>
                The McDowell Mountain range is made up of mountains formed from miocene deposits left around five million years ago. 
                The mountains that lie in Scottsdale are a preserve under the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy. The Conservancy was 
                founded in 1991. In the preserve there are eight different trailheads and 19 different hikes. The preserve protects 
                over 30,000 acres. There is also the McDowell Mountain Regional Park which offers over 40 miles of trails. The park 
                has a range of trails with a variety of difficulties and lengths.

        <h2>Flora and Fauna in Pheonix</h2>
        <p class="bold">There is a variety of cool desert plants and animals that hikers might see when they come to Phoenix. Click on the images below to learn more! </p>
        <div class="tortoise">
            <img src="https://www.phoenixzoo.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sonoran-desert-tortoise-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Desert Tortoise">
            <p> Desert tortoises have several adaptations for surviving in the desert heat. They burrow to escape heat.  
                and can go for long periods of time without food or water. Desert tortoises are herbivores. 
                Tortoises live in burrows that they construct in the sides of washes, hillsides, rock overhangs, or crevices in rocky areas.
                In the Sonoran Desert, wild tortoises can live about 35 or 40 years although some live to be much older. 
                A common way tortoises defend themselves is to empty their bladder or "pee" if they are picked up or handled. This could lead to their death if they can't find water soon as they could become dehydrated.

            <img src="https://downbytheriverbandb.com/wp-content/uploads//2014/02/Roadrunner-on-the-move.jpg" alt="Roadrunner">
            <p> To survive the cold winter nights and hot sunny summer days, the roadrunner has several adaptations. 
                On cold winter nights, they go into torpor which is a state in which their body slows down and uses less energy. 
                During the hot summers, roadrunners are active during dawn and dusk and avoid moving about during the heat of the day. 
                Roadrunners also have a special gland that helps them excrete salt. This helps them save water. 
                Roadrunners eat a variety of foods including insects, scorpions, spiders, tarantulas, and even small vertebrates like rodents, lizards, and snakes, as well as seeds and berries.

            <p> Saguaro cacti are an iconic part of the Sonoran desert landscape. They only live in the Sonoran desert and are an important part of the ecosystem of the desert. 
                Several different types of animals can live inside of a saguaro boot, a container formed by a hard tissue formed inside of the saguaro by birds. 
                It is the largest cactus in the United States and can grow up to 50 feet tall. Their root systems can extend as far as 100 feet to soak up rainwater in the ground. 
                These cacti can live up to 200 years. At ten years old, a saguaro cactus is about the size of a thumb.

            <p> Prickly pear cacti can be recognized by their large, flat pads. They produce bright red fruit beginning in July. 
                They live over 20 years. The red fruit or pear of this cactus are also known as "tuna". 
                The most common species of Prickly Pear in the Sonoran Desert is called the Engelmann prickly pear. This variety can grows up to 5 feet tall and to a width of 10-15 feet.
